# Box 4.0 Features and Changes

Box 4.0 has brought a lot of great new features, but also some breaking changes. They are documented here to help you upgrade. 


## Dot notation access by keys!


## Adding merge_update as its own function, update now works like the default dictionary update


## Support for adding two Boxes together


## No more Python 2 support

Python 2 is soon officially EOL and Box 4 won't support it in anyway. Box 3 will not be updated, other than will consider PRs for bugs or security issues.

## Removing Ordered Box

As dictionaries are ordered by default in Python 3.6+ there is no point to continue writing and testing code outside of that. 

## Removing `BoxObject`

As BoxObject was not cross platform compatible and had some [issues](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/issues/132) it has been removed.
